Date Time Transformation:
In this project I need to write a program to transform the
given datetime string to different formats. The initial requirement is to transform it to any
different time zone. 

First of all I need to transform a given data time to different time zone ,

For example, If the given date time is "03/15/2022 10:23:45 pm",So I defined the transformed format as "MM/dd/yyyy hh:mm:ss a EEEE"
Fortunately, I can import the library that comes with java to convert the time zone
The specific implementation code is in test-case1

The output shown below:
